pTo kickoff 2013, the a href=http://make.wordpress.org/events/WordPress Events Contributor Group/a was launched, and is looking for volunteers for a href=http://make.wordpress.org/events/2012/11/13/wordpress-tv-event-video-management/WordPress.tv moderation/a, a href=http://make.wordpress.org/events/2012/11/13/event-planning-training-materials/materials for event planners/a, a href=http://make.wordpress.org/events/2012/11/13/new-organizer-mentorship-program/new WordCamp organizer mentorships/a, a href=http://make.wordpress.org/events/2012/08/20/multi-event-sponsorship-program/making it easier for organizations to sponsor multiple events/a, a href=http://make.wordpress.org/events/2012/11/13/wordcamp-base-theme-page-templates/improvements to the WordCamp Base theme/a, and a href=http://make.wordpress.org/events/2012/11/13/review-wordcamp-guidelines/reviewing the current WordCamp guidelines/a./p

pSo, in the summer of 2011, we a href=http://jaycollier.net/strategy/collaboration/discovery/developed a digital strategy/a, a href=http://jaycollier.net/strategy/collaboration/creating-learnmaine/built a demonstration site/anbsp;in less than a monthnbsp;andnbsp;drafted a href=http://mainelearning.net/about/user-generated-content-policy/policies for user-generated content/a. Initial funding was earmarked in November 2011, the initiative wasnbsp;integrated into the Department’snbsp;a href=http://www.maine.gov/doe/plan/index.htmlstrategic plan/anbsp;in January 2012, andnbsp;the version 2.0nbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.netproduction site/a went live in February 2012. During the following months, the Department approved 21 practice groupsnbsp;with 250 active members./p
h2Architecting engagement/h2
pa href=http://jaycollier.net/files/2013/01/ocp-engagement.png class=fancybox rel=gallery-0img class=alignright size-medium wp-image-22496 no-border title=ocp-engagement alt= src=http://jaycollier.net/files/2013/01/ocp-engagement-300x236.png width=300 height=236 //a/p
pFrom day one, we wanted the platform to support increasing levels of engagement, from initial observations (“lurking,” in the positive sense) all the way through to moderating and leading practice teams./p
pAlthough the OCOP would be launched quietly and was limited to Department-approved practice groups and members during 2012, from the start all group conversations were intended to be visible to the world: a virtual version of the a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)fishbowl model/anbsp;of collaboration./p
pWe wanted members to be able to receive activity notifications immediately or via daily or weekly digests. We wanted visitors to be able tonbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.net/about/follow any group/anbsp;by subscribing to its feed via the Blogtrottr service./p
pThen, after implementing the collaboration features, the next phase would be anbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.net/resources/learning resources directory/a, which would contain recommendations (via URL) for:/p
ul
liDigital learningnbsp;strongobjects/strong, such as content, multimedia, applications, lesson plans, and syllabi that can be used anytime, on any device, in any setting, at home and in classrooms, and through self-directed study and professional development initiatives, and/li
liDigital learningnbsp;strongopportunities/strong, including classes, courses, workshops and professional development sessions and that provide live interaction between, and among, students and teachers, learning coaches and community mentors/li
/ul
pWhereas there already countless global resource repositories — containing both free and “premium” objects — when we began, there were no registries that organized links to resources based on Maine-specific needs and standards, and no single repository contained links to local Maine learning resources: expanded learning opportunities, service-learning projects, and community mentoring opportunities. Our Resource Directory was created to do just that./p
h2Laying the foundations/h2
pFrom the start, our goal was to deliver anbsp;a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_productminimal viable product/anbsp;to demonstrate potential, and then to rapidly iterate while adding functions requested by our early users. Our first step was to identify the platform that could be quickly configured to support familiar kinds of online collaboration — forums, document sharing, wiki pages, blog posts, and status updates — while being able to support our vision of the ideal future platform./p
pSo, we pulled together all of the requests we’d received from DOE staff and constituents (including features from a series of previous projects) and created a detailednbsp;a href=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnN5FWMlt7YEdENCalRRdExFU3RfSkE1X0J3dUhhQWclist of criteria/a, for which we made an initial evaluation using thenbsp;a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_group_techniqueNGT/anbsp;ranking technique. (See tabs along the bottom of thenbsp;a href=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnN5FWMlt7YEdENCalRRdExFU3RfSkE1X0J3dUhhQWcspreadsheet/anbsp;for details.)/p
pSince we knew we wanted to create a framework that could benbsp;easily replicated by school districts and other learning organizations and jurisdictions, andnbsp;at low cost,nbsp;we started with the open-source frameworks supported by our state’s IT office: Drupal andnbsp;WordPress. We determined that both platforms were viable, and chose WordPress because it could be easily configured by non-technologists. The BuddyPress environment was critical to meeting our defined criteria./p
h2Building on WordPress and BuddyPress/h2
pWe started with minimal resources — 40% of my time, external hosting services, and about 40 hours for back-end administration and quality control for plugin code for the first 9 months. We contracted with SiteGround fornbsp;a href=http://www.siteground.com/vps_hosting.htmcloud VPS hosting/anbsp;and with BuddyPress developernbsp;a href=http://buddypress.org/community/members/boonebgorges/profile/Boone Gorges/anbsp;for back-end support. Boone set up a publicnbsp;a href=https://github.com/MaineLearning/MaineLearningGitHub repository/anbsp;andnbsp;configured our server for the Git development workflow. I installednbsp;a href=http://www.mamp.info/en/MAMP/a,nbsp;a href=http://code.google.com/p/gmask/Gas Mask/a, andnbsp;a href=http://mac.github.com/GitHub for Mac/anbsp;on my own machine for local development./p
pSince I am a strategist (rather than a back-end developer), I found it quite easy to implement desired features by finding and evaluating WordPress plugins, installing, activating, and testing them on my local machine, and, if acceptable, pushing them to the current development branch at GitHub, all without needing coding experience. When needed, I asked Boone to provide recommendations, check for PHP errors, and add site-specific code to meet our needs. He would then push to production./p
h3Configuration and theming/h3
pTo get started, I installed WordPress multisite (using subdirectories rather than subdomains) and installed BuddyPress on the main site. I chose to use the BuddyPress default theme for the main site and the Genesis framework for subsites; all customizations were to child themes. I made continuous interface tweaks via the Custom CSS plugin, and for each periodic push from development to production, I moved those changes into each theme’s styles.css file for versioning./p
h3Plugins/h3
pHere are some of the key plugins we’re currently using with WP 3.4 and BP 1.6. Most of these are perennials that have been maintained through many core software updates, and across multiple projects./p

pOf course, our use of these plugins is always provisional; I continue to evaluate alternatives that will meet our requirements even better. Indeed, we are already in the process of replacing some of these plugins with alternatives./p
h3Customization/h3
pWe added a number of code snippets to the functions file for minor customizations:/p
ul
liWe added navigation buttons to activity stream items/li
liWe changed the default member avatar/li
liWe loaded common site-specific CSS styles into TinyMCE drop-down menus/li

/ul
h3A note on custom contentnbsp;types, fields, and taxonomies/h3
pFor the Learning Resources Directory, I needed to create and maintainnbsp;custom post types, field groups, and taxonomies to support a rather complex data structure for metadata for our learning standards: thenbsp;a href=http://www.maine.gov/education/lres/pei/index.htmlMaine Learning Results/anbsp;andnbsp;a href=http://www.corestandards.org/the-standardsCommon Core State Standards/a./p
pAfter having tried nearly every plugin option (and combination), I settled onnbsp;a href=http://wp-types.com/WP Types amp; Views/anbsp;(now called WP-Toolset), which allowed me to rapidly prototype and improve data structures. Then, I usednbsp;a href=http://www.gravityforms.com/Gravity Forms/anbsp;to createnbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.net/resources/recommend/front-end forms/anbsp;to prompt educators to organize and classify their recommended resources./p
pThis work has only just begun, but WP-Toolset has provided all the features we’ve needed; indeed it can be compared favorably with the Blocks, Views, Panes, and Panels modules and functions for Drupal. Indeed, I’ll be experimenting with WP-Toolset’snbsp;a href=http://wp-types.com/home/cred/CRED feature/a to more easily integration between front-end forms and structured data./p
h2Today/h2
pThenbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.net/online community of practice/anbsp;has now been fully-functional since March, 2012. Since then,nbsp;the Department has approved 21 practice groupsnbsp;with 250 members; the more active groups have included: thenbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.net/groups/dlag/Digital Learning Advisory Group/a, thenbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.net/groups/cdln/Cross Discipline Literacy Network/anbsp;(and its 10 subgroups), thenbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.net/groups/arts-leaders/Maine Arts Education Leaders/anbsp;cohort, and thenbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.net/groups/dcs/Digital Citizenship in Schools/anbsp;discussion group. We recently added a space for service-learning coordinators and practitioners, and maintain a list of group and membership requests./p
pThenbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.net/resourceslearning resources directory/anbsp;has been tested by a variety of educators, with continuous improvements based on user feedback. The Arts Education cohort is developing a peer review process for those who ask for review of their submissions. Wikipedia-style ratings will be implemented next./p
pCurrently, program direction, platform administration, and community stewardship functions are being performed by myself (Jay Collier) and our back-end developer, Boone Gorges (core software developer for the collaboration software)./p
h2Next phase/h2
pWe’ve now been live for almost one year. As we approach the end of our current funding and contract cycles, the state of Maine has been working to sustain MaineLearning.net./p
ul
liThe Department of Education has been planning to initiate a public communications campaign and is seeking funding to fund program leadership and community stewardship through the next level of service, including those potential enhancements listed below./li
liThe state’s Office of Information Technology has been developing an RFP that will seek external vendors to providenbsp;Internet hosting, software management, and back-end development to support the continuous improvement of the platform when the current funding and contracts end this spring./li
/ul
pWith sufficient resources, we are considering many potential enhancements, including the following, all of which are possible within the current framework, given additional staffing:/p
h4Potential collaboration enhancements/h4

liAllowing open group applications and selecting new groups based upon capacity/li
liProfessional development support, including organic groups for sustained collaboration between webinars, seminars, and workshops/li

h2Toward the future of learning/h2
pIn a href=http://www.maine.gov/doe/plan/index.htmlemEducation Evolving/em /a(a href=http://www.maine.gov/doe/plan/strategic_plan_web_final.pdfPDF/a) — Maine’s 2012 strategic plan for learning in Maine — Commissioner Bowen worked with educators around the state to define the challenges and opportunities of 21st-century education./p
blockquotepTo build on the great work being done in Maine’s schools today, and to move from a century-old model of schooling to a more effective, learner-centered approach in the process, will require a steady focus on a handful of core priorities organized around meeting the individual learning needs of all students …/p
pSuch a move won’t take place through the imposition of heavy-handed mandates or one-size-fits-all approaches from Augusta, but by building on the innovative work being done in schools across Maine already and by employing strategies to increase collaboration and sharing of best practices…./p
pAs Harvard’s Tony Wagner argues in his book emThe Global Achievement Gap/em, teaching has been and continues to be a largely solitary practice providing few opportunities for collaboration and sharing of best practices…/p
pWith the advent of nbsp;the Internet, the sharing of new ideas and new approaches to teaching can be far more readily facilitated. Instructional materials, research on best practices, and even videos of effective instructional methods can be shared instantly across the state and around the world./p
/blockquote
pCollaborative, learner-centered education is at the heart of Maine’s strategy for transforming learning communities for this new era and a href=http://MaineLearning.netMaineLearning.net/anbsp;supports that strategy./p

pSo, we pulled together all of the requests we’d received from DOE staff and constituents (including features from a series of previous projects) and created a detailednbsp;a href=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnN5FWMlt7YEdENCalRRdExFU3RfSkE1X0J3dUhhQWclist of criteria/a, for which we made an initial evaluation using thenbsp;a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_group_techniqueNGT/anbsp;ranking technique. (See tabs along the bottom of thenbsp;a href=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnN5FWMlt7YEdENCalRRdExFU3RfSkE1X0J3dUhhQWcspreadsheet/anbsp;for details.)/p
pSince we knew we wanted to create a framework that could benbsp;easily replicated by school districts and other learning organizations and jurisdictions, andnbsp;at low cost,nbsp;we started with the open-source frameworks supported by our state’s IT office: Drupal andnbsp;WordPress. We determined that both platforms were viable, and chose WordPress because it could be easily configured by non-technologists. The BuddyPress environment was critical to meeting our defined criteria./p
h2Building on WordPress and BuddyPress/h2
pWe started with minimal resources — 40% of my time, external hosting services, and about 40 hours for back-end administration and quality control for plugin code for the first 9 months. We contracted with SiteGround fornbsp;a href=http://www.siteground.com/vps_hosting.htmcloud VPS hosting/anbsp;and with BuddyPress developernbsp;a href=http://buddypress.org/community/members/boonebgorges/profile/Boone Gorges/anbsp;for back-end support. Boone set up a publicnbsp;a href=https://github.com/MaineLearning/MaineLearningGitHub repository/anbsp;andnbsp;configured our server for the Git development workflow. I installednbsp;a href=http://www.mamp.info/en/MAMP/a,nbsp;a href=http://code.google.com/p/gmask/Gas Mask/a, andnbsp;a href=http://mac.github.com/GitHub for Mac/anbsp;on my own machine for local development./p
pSince I am a strategist (rather than a back-end developer), I found it quite easy to implement desired features by finding and evaluating WordPress plugins, installing, activating, and testing them on my local machine, and, if acceptable, pushing them to the current development branch at GitHub, all without needing coding experience. When needed, I asked Boone to provide recommendations, check for PHP errors, and add site-specific code to meet our needs. He would then push to production./p
h3Configuration and theming/h3
pTo get started, I installed WordPress multisite (using subdirectories rather than subdomains) and installed BuddyPress on the main site. I chose to use the BuddyPress default theme for the main site and the Genesis framework for subsites; all customizations were to child themes. I made continuous interface tweaks via the Custom CSS plugin, and for each periodic push from development to production, I moved those changes into each theme’s styles.css file for versioning./p
h3Plugins/h3
pHere are some of the key plugins we’re currently using with WP 3.4 and BP 1.6. Most of these are perennials that have been maintained through many core software updates, and across multiple projects./p

pOf course, our use of these plugins is always provisional; I continue to evaluate alternatives that will meet our requirements even better. Indeed, we are already in the process of replacing some of these plugins with alternatives./p
h3Customization/h3
pWe added a number of code snippets to the functions file for minor customizations:/p
ul
liWe added navigation buttons to activity stream items/li
liWe changed the default member avatar/li
liWe loaded common site-specific CSS styles into TinyMCE drop-down menus/li
liWe adaptednbsp;a href=http://helen.wordpress.com/2012/01/08/using-chosen-for-a-replacement-taxonomy-metabox/Helen Hou’s implementation/anbsp;of the Chosen multi-select list styling to simplify back-end metaboxes for multiple taxonomies/li
/ul
h3A note on custom contentnbsp;types, fields, and taxonomies/h3
pFor the Learning Resources Directory, I needed to create and maintainnbsp;custom post types, field groups, and taxonomies to support a rather complex data structure for metadata for our learning standards: thenbsp;a href=http://www.maine.gov/education/lres/pei/index.htmlMaine Learning Results/anbsp;andnbsp;a href=http://www.corestandards.org/the-standardsCommon Core State Standards/a./p
pAfter having tried nearly every plugin option (and combination), I settled onnbsp;a href=http://wp-types.com/WP Types amp; Views/anbsp;(now called WP-Toolset), which allowed me to rapidly prototype and improve data structures. Then, I usednbsp;a href=http://www.gravityforms.com/Gravity Forms/anbsp;to createnbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.net/resources/recommend/front-end forms/anbsp;to prompt educators to organize and classify their recommended resources./p
pThis work has only just begun, but WP-Toolset has provided all the features we’ve needed; indeed it can be compared favorably with the Blocks, Views, Panes, and Panels modules and functions for Drupal. Indeed, I’ll be experimenting with WP-Toolset’snbsp;a href=http://wp-types.com/home/cred/CRED feature/a to more easily integration between front-end forms and structured data./p
h2Today/h2
pThenbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.net/online community of practice/anbsp;has now been fully-functional since March, 2012. Since then,nbsp;the Department has approved 21 practice groupsnbsp;with 250 members; the more active groups have included: thenbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.net/groups/dlag/Digital Learning Advisory Group/a, thenbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.net/groups/cdln/Cross Discipline Literacy Network/anbsp;(and its 10 subgroups), thenbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.net/groups/arts-leaders/Maine Arts Education Leaders/anbsp;cohort, and thenbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.net/groups/dcs/Digital Citizenship in Schools/anbsp;discussion group. We recently added a space for service-learning coordinators and practitioners, and maintain a list of group and membership requests./p
pThenbsp;a href=http://mainelearning.net/resourceslearning resources directory/anbsp;has been tested by a variety of educators, with continuous improvements based on user feedback. The Arts Education cohort is developing a peer review process for those who ask for review of their submissions. Wikipedia-style ratings will be implemented next./p
pCurrently, program direction, platform administration, and community stewardship functions are being performed by myself (Jay Collier) and our back-end developer, Boone Gorges (core software developer for the collaboration software)./p
h2Next phase/h2
pWe’ve now been live for almost one year. As we approach the end of our current funding and contract cycles, the state of Maine has been working to sustain MaineLearning.net./p
ul
liThe Department of Education has been planning to initiate a public communications campaign and is seeking funding to fund program leadership and community stewardship through the next level of service, including those potential enhancements listed below./li
liThe state’s Office of Information Technology has been developing an RFP that will seek external vendors to providenbsp;Internet hosting, software management, and back-end development to support the continuous improvement of the platform when the current funding and contracts end this spring./li
/ul
pWith sufficient resources, we are considering many potential enhancements, including the following, all of which are possible within the current framework, given additional staffing:/p
h4Potential collaboration enhancements/h4
ul
liAllowing open group applications and selecting new groups based upon capacity/li
liProfessional development support, including organic groups for sustained collaboration between webinars, seminars, and workshops/li
liActive management of resource vetting teams, including rubric development, and credential design (badges)/li
liAvailability of sub-sites (blogs) for every group, upon request/li
/ul
h4Potential resource directory enhancements/h4
ul
liStatewide promotion for crowdsourced resource sharing/li
liSimplified resource submission interfaces and predefined search results/li
liMultiple levels of evaluation options, from thumbs up/down, to multi-question reviews, to peer review workflows/li
liExchange of vetting data (paradata) via US DOE Learning Registry and other repositories/li
liIngest of pre-existing learning resources, from vetted OERs to professional development objects, to community learning opportunities/li
/ul
h4Potential administrative initiatives/h4
ul
liGrant applications for funding from regional and national foundations/li
liConsulting with other jurisdictions that wish to replicate the model/li
liContributing lessons learned and custom add-ons back to the open-source community/li
liInvestigating viability of integrating ePortfolio and learning management (ScholarPress) features into the platform/li

h2Toward the future of learning/h2
pIn a href=http://www.maine.gov/doe/plan/index.htmlemEducation Evolving/em /a(a href=http://www.maine.gov/doe/plan/strategic_plan_web_final.pdfPDF/a) — Maine’s 2012 strategic plan for learning in Maine — Commissioner Bowen worked with educators around the state to define the challenges and opportunities of 21st-century education./p
blockquotepTo build on the great work being done in Maine’s schools today, and to move from a century-old model of schooling to a more effective, learner-centered approach in the process, will require a steady focus on a handful of core priorities organized around meeting the individual learning needs of all students …/p
pSuch a move won’t take place through the imposition of heavy-handed mandates or one-size-fits-all approaches from Augusta, but by building on the innovative work being done in schools across Maine already and by employing strategies to increase collaboration and sharing of best practices…./p
pAs Harvard’s Tony Wagner argues in his book emThe Global Achievement Gap/em, teaching has been and continues to be a largely solitary practice providing few opportunities for collaboration and sharing of best practices…/p
pWith the advent of nbsp;the Internet, the sharing of new ideas and new approaches to teaching can be far more readily facilitated. Instructional materials, research on best practices, and even videos of effective instructional methods can be shared instantly across the state and around the world./p
/blockquote
pCollaborative, learner-centered education is at the heart of Maine’s strategy for transforming learning communities for this new era and a href=http://MaineLearning.netMaineLearning.net/anbsp;supports that strategy./p
